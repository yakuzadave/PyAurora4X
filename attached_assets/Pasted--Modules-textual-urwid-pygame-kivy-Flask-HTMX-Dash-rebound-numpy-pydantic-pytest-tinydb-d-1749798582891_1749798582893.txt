# üöÄ Project Plan: "PyAurora 4X" (Codename)

* * *

## üåå

## PHASE 0: Foundations & MVP Planning

  

Goal: Set up repo, requirements, and design docs before coding anything real.

- Define core game vision and priorities
- Choose core libraries: textual, rebound, pydantic, pytest, etc.
- Establish modular folder structure (/engine, /ui, /data, /core)
- Draft initial tech tree and design doc (Google Docs, Notion, Markdown)
- Set up version control, pre-commit hooks, and a project README
- MVP Definition: Minimum game loop, star system view, fleet move, research

## üåë

## PHASE 1: Core Simulation Engine & Data Models

  

Goal: World sim is possible without a UI; text-based or automated tests drive progress.

- Implement Star System & Planet Generator (with REBOUND for orbits)
- Add basic Empire, Fleet, Ship, Colony Python classes (pydantic or custom)
- Design serialization for save/load (json, pydantic, or tinydb)
- Build event-driven scheduler (GameScheduler, pulse-based ticks)
- CLI/debug test harness for stepping simulation

  

Deliverable:

Command-line simulation that generates a solar system and steps through time, printing to console.

* * *

## üåì

## PHASE 2: Core TUI/GUI and Interactive Loop

  

Goal: Game is playable in a terminal with a "main menu," system viewer, and tick button.

- Create main app window in Textual
- Implement Star System Map widget (shows star, planets, orbits with ASCII/Unicode)
- Add Fleet Panel (lists fleets, ships, movement status)
- Integrate Advance Time controls (5s, 30s, 1m, 1y pulses)
- Display empire stats (resources, research, events)
- Wire up REBOUND so planet positions update per tick

  

Deliverable:

Fully interactive terminal game where you can view systems, step time, and see planets/fleets move.

* * *

## üåî

## PHASE 3: Gameplay Loops -- Movement, Research, and Orders

  

Goal: Core Aurora experience--fleets move, you can issue orders, research progresses, and time advances.

- Implement Fleet Movement (assign orders: move, survey, transfer)
- Create Research Panel (assign projects, see progress, finish techs)
- Allow Colonization/Resource extraction (basic colony creation, mining, income)
- Introduce notifications/messages (orders complete, anomalies found, tech complete)
- Refactor event scheduler to handle user-issued orders and automation

  

Deliverable:

You can move ships, research tech, colonize, and see cause-effect. Simulation persists through save/load.

* * *

## üåï

## PHASE 4: Advanced Systems and AI

  

Goal: Simulation feels alive, with opposing empires and nontrivial interactions.

- Add basic AI empires (random or simple strategy; use same systems as player)
- Model diplomacy, trade, and war (simple, extensible)
- Expand combat (missiles, sensors, PD, basic damage system)
- Add "fog of war": sensors, detection, and hidden info
- Implement multi-system navigation (jumps, hyperlanes, starmap)

  

Deliverable:

Players and AI empires can explore, expand, and compete in multiple star systems. Fleet battles are possible.

* * *

## üåó

## PHASE 5: Polish, Modding, and Extensibility

  

Goal: Not just functional but fun and extensible. Set up for future content or modding.

- Refine Textual UI: tooltips, dynamic theming, hotkeys, help
- Add mod support: load techs, ship parts, planets from JSON/YAML
- Improve save/load robustness, add error recovery
- Add docs: code, modding, design philosophy
- Package for pip or PyPI install, create "Getting Started" guide

  

Deliverable:

Community can easily extend, mod, or play the game. Game can be shipped as a package.

* * *

## üß†

## Phase "‚àû": Stretch Features / Wishlist

  

Optional "Aurora++" stuff:

- Advanced orbital mechanics for ships (Newtonian drift, interplanetary transfer)
- Custom event scripting (random anomalies, story beats)
- "Quick look" web interface (optional Flask/HTMX)
- Procedural races, asymmetric start positions
- Multiplayer hotseat or async support

# Tech Stack/Dependencies

- Textual: Terminal UI (main driver)
- REBOUND: Orbits, system dynamics
- Pydantic: (optional, for robust serialization and validation)
- Pytest: Automated tests
- TinyDB or JSON: Save games, modding (easy to migrate to DB later)
- Black, mypy, ruff: Code style, linting, type checking
