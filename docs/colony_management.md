# Colony Management

PyAurora 4X now includes a simple colony management system. Each empire starts
with a colony on its homeworld. Colonies track population, basic
infrastructure and local stockpiles.

During time advancement colonies grow based on their `growth_rate` and produce
minerals from any `mine` infrastructure. The production is added directly to the
colony stockpiles. These mechanics provide the foundation for future industry
and economy features.
