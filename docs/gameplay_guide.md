# Gameplay Guide

This guide explains the basic mechanics of **PyAurora 4X**. It now includes
information about orbital transfers used when moving fleets between planets.

## Fleet Movement

Fleets use Hohmann or bi-elliptic transfer orbits to travel between planetary
bodies. When REBOUND is installed the game calculates realistic transfer times
based on current orbital positions. The AI will choose the most efficient method
and display the estimated arrival time in orders.
