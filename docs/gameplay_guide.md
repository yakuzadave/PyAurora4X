# Gameplay Guide

This guide covers the essentials of playing **PyAurora 4X**. It explains the terminal interface, common commands, and how a typical session progresses.

## UI Overview

PyAurora 4X runs entirely in the terminal using the Textual library. After launching the game you will see the main star system map surrounded by informational panels.

- **Top Bar** – displays the current date and active game speed
- **Left Panel** – context-sensitive commands for colonies, fleets, and research
- **Right Panel** – event log with messages and notifications
- **Main Area** – orbital view of planets, moons, and fleets

Navigate between elements with the arrow keys or `j`/`k`. Press `Enter` to activate a highlighted option.

## Basic Commands

- `n` – start a new game
- `l` – load an existing save
- `s` – save the current game
- `q` – quit to the terminal
- `?` – open the help screen
- `F1`–`F5` – focus the first five fleets for quick selection

Other shortcuts appear at the bottom of the UI when available.

## Gameplay Phases

1. **Setup** – create your empire and choose starting conditions
2. **Exploration & Expansion** – survey systems and found new colonies
3. **Research & Development** – unlock technologies to improve ships and industry
4. **Fleet Operations** – organize forces and assign missions
5. **Conflict** – engage rival powers or defend your territory

## Fleet Movement

Fleets use Hohmann or bi-elliptic transfer orbits to travel between planetary bodies. When REBOUND is installed the game calculates realistic transfer times based on current positions. The most efficient method is selected automatically and the arrival time is displayed in each order.
